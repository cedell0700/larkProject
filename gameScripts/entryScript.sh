Wasting no more time, wanting to get out of the brutal desert sun, you step inside...

CRASH!!!

The heavy stone door slams shut behind you.

There's no going back.

You are met with cool air, and complete darkness.

Use "ls -F" to light your torch and view your surroundings.
	+ "ls" is the command you use to view what's inside the "room" you're in.
	+ The "-F" is an option used to differentiate between different types of contents.
		- The names of "rooms" (folders) will end in a forward slash \/
		- The names of "encounters" (programs) will end in an asterisk*
		- The names of "tablets" (text files) will have no suffix
