You pass dozens of illusionary doorways to find one, real doorway.

You pass through it, entering a small room.

Within it, you find a tablet that seems to be encoded with an ancient Egyptian cipher.

Looking past that tablet, there is a doorway blocked by a gate with four buttons beside it.

Thankfully, being the prepared explorer you are, you've brought a journal contains cipher characters and their English counterparts.

You set your book on the ground to compare to the tablet.

Use "|" (known as the "pipe" character) between commands to "combine" them.
	+ The syntax is "command1 [-(option1)(option2)] | command2 [-(option1)(option2)]"
		- Note: brackets [] indicate optional inputs. Some commands do not require options.

Use "tr" to "translate" characters. This utility takes text input, and transforms characters into specified counterparts.
	+ The syntax is "tr '(originalCharacter1)[(originalCharacter2)...]' '(translatedCharacter1)[(translatedCharacter2)...]'"
		- For example, "tr 'abc' 'ABC'" would translate any lowercase a, b, or c in a text to its capitalized counterpart.
		- As another example, "tr 'yL' 'eH'" would replace every "y" with "e" a,d "L" with "H". When used with the phrase "Lyllo tLyry", it would output "Hello tHere". 
	+ Note: This command can't be used alone. Use the pipe "|" operator to first read the tablet, then translate its contents.
