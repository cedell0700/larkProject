Name of Game: The Great Pyramid Heist

Developed by: Colby Edell, Andrew Piasecki, Louis Irias

Narrative:

	It is the year 2286 B.C. 
	You are Abdelkader Nuru, a scavenger looking to steal the treasures hidden in Khufu’s Pyramid, constructed some 500 years ago in the Old Kingdom of Egypt. 
	Reaching the treasures that await you in Khufu’s crypt won’t be easy.
	You must solve puzzles and battle powerful Egyptian deities that stand in your way. 
	Will you triumph, or succumb to the challenge like all those who came before you? 

Instructions:

	Type ". startGame.sh", followed by a press of the ENTER key, to begin your journey.
	The game will guide you with the rest as you go along, but generally, remember to run scripts using "source scriptName" for the game to work correctly.
	If you're not sure how to complete a particular puzzle, do some more research on the command(s) mentioned when you entered the puzzle room.
	A good place to start is the Manual utility ("man utilityName".)
