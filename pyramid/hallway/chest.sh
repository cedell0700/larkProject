cat <<chestLocked

This chest is locked.

Perhaps you've missed something?

Use the ".." argument with the "cd" command to move back a room.

chestLocked

touch ../key.sh

chmod +x ../key.sh

cat <<keyScript > ../key.sh

cat <<keyCollect

After a thorough search of the room you first entered in, you find a rusty metal key laying in the corner.

You pick it up and store it in your pocket.

keyCollect

rm -rf key.sh

cat <<keyAcquired > ./hallway/chest.sh

cat <<chestUnlocked

You brush off the dust caked over the keyhole and insert the key.

It turns, and the chest creaks open.

Inside, you find a stone tablet with what seems to be some writing engraved on it.

Use "cat tablet" to read it.

hiddenPassagewayAllowed="true"

touch tablet

cat <<tabletContents > tablet

USE "-a" TO UNCOVER WHAT IS HIDING.

Hmm... perhaps this is another option for your "ls" command?
