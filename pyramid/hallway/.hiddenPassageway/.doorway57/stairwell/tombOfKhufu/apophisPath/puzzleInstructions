# Use "sed" (Stream Editor) to complete this task efficiently.
	+ The syntax is "sed [options] '[sedCommands]' (sourceFileName)"
	+ The "-i" option with sed allows you to edit a file with commands.
	+ The "s" sed command will allow you to substitute one piece of text for another. The syntax is 's/replacementText/originalText/[flags]'
		-  The "g" flag with the "s" sed command makes it so every match in the file gets replaced, not just the first.
	+ Sed commands are separated by forward-slashes (/).
	+ As an example, to replace every instance of "hello" with "goodbye" in a text file named "textFile", we would use "sed -i 's/hello/goodbye/g' textFile"
