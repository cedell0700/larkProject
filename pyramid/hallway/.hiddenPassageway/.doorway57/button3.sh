#Use an alias to repeat lengthy commands more easily.
	+ The syntax is "alias alias_name='(command)'"
	+ For instance, you can use "alias translate=tr 'Y9UZXCBT45A3KS216LJV8FH7NQ' 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'" will allow you to run the long "tr" line just by typing "translate."
		- So, once you do this, you could use "cat tablet | translate" instead of the long command you used before.
		- You can use the up arrow keys to view previous commands, that way you don't have to type it all out again just to create the alias.
