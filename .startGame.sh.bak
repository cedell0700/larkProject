Following rumors of an unexplored pyramid in the desert, you begin your journey with a car ride out of the city.

You then saddle up on your camel and begin combing the desert for hours.

Hours became days.

Days became weeks.

Finally, just as you were about to give up and head back, a triangle-shaped shadow appears in the distance.

You hop off of your camel, and peer up at the massive building towering above you.

Use "cd placeName" to move between areas.
	+ "cd" is the command you use to move between "rooms" (folders).
	+ The "placeName" after the command is an argument, which is something the command needs to be provided.
	+ In this case, cd needs to be provided the name of the place (folder) you want to move to.
	+ For example, use "cd pyramid" to enter the pyramid.
